/**
 * Task error classifier.
 *
 * Users complained that task error logs weren't actionable — raw strings like
 * "Error during evaluation: Required attribute 'output' for key 'result' not
 * found for span <uuid>" give them no idea what to fix. This module maps the
 * known error strings the backend produces (see `tracer/utils/eval.py` and
 * `tracer/utils/external_eval.py`) into structured categories with a title,
 * a severity, a normalized message, and actionable hints.
 *
 * The backend (`tracer/views/eval_task.py::get_eval_task_logs`) now pre-
 * aggregates errors by a normalized form in SQL — it returns an
 * `error_groups` array of `{ normalized, count, sample }` rows. This
 * module no longer does client-side grouping; `classifyTaskError` is
 * called per group to attach the title / icon / severity / hints based
 * on the sample. Keeping the classifier client-side lets us iterate on
 * copy and hints without a backend deploy.

//   title: short human-readable label ("Missing attribute on spans")
//   icon: solar iconify icon (theme-reactive via MUI sx)
//   severity: always "error" — every entry in this log is a failed eval
//     run that produced no result. The "warning" tier was removed
//     because it visually downgraded real failures (the amber color
//     made users assume they were soft alerts). Whether the failure
//     is transient or permanent is communicated in the hint copy
//     ("almost always transient — re-run the task") rather than via
//     a softer color.
//   hints(match): list of actionable next-step strings, may interpolate
//     regex capture groups
//   normalize(stripped, match): canonical form used for grouping — strips
//     span IDs, request IDs, and other per-row noise so duplicate errors
//     collapse into one group
