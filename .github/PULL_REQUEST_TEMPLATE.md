## E2E coverage

<!-- One line. `yarn coverage` (from e2e/) tells you which to use:
     E2E: new <ID>            a flow added in this PR (appears in the FLOWS.md diff)
     E2E: updated <ID>        an existing flow changed in this PR
     E2E: covered-by <ID>     an existing, unchanged flow already proves this change
     E2E: exempt (<reason>)   docs | tooling | tests-only | not-in-stack | backend-internal |

## 1) What changes were done

<!-- Use sub-sections A, B, C... to describe each logical group of changes. -->
<!-- Be explicit about what the user sees vs what changed internally. -->

**A. [Change group 1 — e.g. "Eval mapping dropdown for simulations"]**

- [What changed for the user]
- [What changed in the API/serializer, if any]
- [What changed in the model/storage, if any]

**B. [Change group 2]**

- ...

**C. [Architecture / layering changes, if any]**

- [What moved where and why]

---

## 2) Why the changes were done

<!-- Use bullet points. Cover product/UX rationale, technical rationale, and any architectural decisions. -->

- **Product/UX:** [why this matters to the user]
- **Technical:** [why this approach over alternatives]
- **Architecture:** [layering, DRY, separation of concerns — if applicable]

---

## 3) Tests written + scenarios each covers

<!-- List every test file, then every test case with a one-liner description of what it covers. -->
<!-- Format: test_file.py — description of what the suite tests -->

**`test_file_1.py`** — [what this suite tests]

- `test_case_name` — [what it covers]
- `test_case_name` — [what it covers]
- `test_case_name` — [what it covers]

**`test_file_2.py`** — [what this suite tests]

- `test_case_name` — [what it covers]

> Run result: **X passed** across these suites. Lint (ruff) + format (black) clean.

## 4) How to run / test

### Backend tests

```bash
cd futureagi

# Create venv with correct Python (one-time):
uv venv --python 3.11
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -r requirements-test.txt

# Full suite:
bin/test

# By app:
bin/test app model_hub

# Specific file:
bin/test model_hub/tests/test_file.py -v

# Single test by name:
bin/test model_hub/tests/test_file.py -k "test_case_name"

# Stop on first failure:
bin/test -x -v

# Service control (if needed):
bin/test up    # start isolated test services
bin/test down  # tear down
```

### Frontend tests (if applicable)

```bash
cd frontend
eval "$(fnm env)" && fnm use 22
yarn install  # first time on Node 22 only
yarn test:run
```

### Contract verification (if API surface changed)

```bash
# Regenerate swagger:
DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=tfc.settings.test ./scripts/generate-openapi-schema.sh

# Regenerate frontend contracts:
cd frontend && yarn contracts:generate

# Verify contracts pass:
cd frontend && yarn contracts:check
```

### UI steps (manual)

1. Start the stack and log in at **http://localhost:3031**.
2. [Step-by-step to reach the affected screen]
3. [What to verify]

## 5) Screenshots / recordings

<!-- Drag & drop images or GIFs here. Before / after is especially helpful. -->
<!-- Include: test command output screenshot + UI testing screenshots/recordings -->

### Test output
