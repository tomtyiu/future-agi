## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/future-agi/future-agi.git
cd future-agi
./bin/install
```

First boot pulls images from Docker Hub (~30 seconds on a fast connection). No source builds.

`bin/install` does three things:

1. Copies `.env.example` → `.env` if missing (compose's inlined defaults make even an empty `.env` valid for local use).
2. Brings up the stack with `docker compose up -d`.
3. Polls `http://localhost:8000/health/` until the backend is ready, then prompts you to create your first user.

For production, do not rely on local-only defaults. See [`deploy/README.md`](deploy/README.md).

Useful flags:

| Flag                   | What it does                                                     |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--skip-user-creation` | Skip the first-user prompt. Run the `create_user` command later. |
| `--no-up`              | Bootstrap `.env` only; don't start the stack.                    |

When the backend logs `Application startup complete`, open:

- **Frontend**: <http://localhost:3000>
- **Backend API**: <http://localhost:8000>

### Create your first account

If you skipped the prompt at install time, create the admin account via the CLI:

```bash
docker exec -it futureagi-backend-1 python manage.py create_user
```

You will be prompted for your email, full name, and password. Then log in at <http://localhost:3000>.

To pass credentials non-interactively (useful for automated setups):

```bash
docker exec -it futureagi-backend-1 python manage.py create_user \
  --email you@example.com \
  --name "Your Name" \
  --password yourpassword
```

### Reset a password

Self-hosted installs without SMTP cannot deliver a reset email. Two ways round it.

**From the host** — works on any deployment:

```bash
docker exec -it futureagi-backend-1 python manage.py reset_password --email you@example.com
```

You will be prompted for the new password, or pass `--password` to supply it
non-interactively. Any sessions already signed in as that account are signed out.

**In the browser** — set this in `.env` and restart the backend:

```
OSS_RETURN_PASSWORD_RESET_LINK=true
```

"Forgot password" then returns the reset link in its response and takes the user
straight to the set-password screen, no mail required.

> Only turn this on where reaching the instance already implies full trust — a
> laptop install, or a host behind a VPN with no other tenants. The endpoint takes
> no authentication, so anyone who can reach it can request a link for **any**
> address and take over that account. Leave it off on anything internet-facing
> and use the command above.

> **Team invites require email (SMTP).** See the [Email configuration](#email-smtp) section below for setup. Mailgun offers a free tier (100 emails/day) that works well for small self-hosted deployments. Without it, the invite dialog returns a shareable link for each invitee instead of sending mail.

To stop everything: `./bin/uninstall` (or `docker compose down`). Data persists in named volumes across restarts.

To wipe all data: `./bin/uninstall --wipe-data` (or `docker compose down -v`).

To fully remove the install (containers, volumes, `.env`, built images): `./bin/uninstall --purge`.

### Without the installer

If you'd rather run the steps by hand:

```bash
cp .env.example .env       # optional — empty .env works fine for local
docker compose up
```

## Prerequisites

| Requirement    | Minimum                      | Notes                                                                    |
| -------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Docker Engine  | 24.0+                        | Docker Desktop on Mac/Windows, or native Docker on Linux                 |
| Docker Compose | v2.20+                       | `docker compose version` should print v2.x                               |
| RAM            | 8 GB                         | 16 GB recommended (ClickHouse and the worker each hold ~1 GB)            |
| Disk           | 20 GB free                   | Image pulls are ~3 GB; data grows from there                             |
| CPU            | 4 cores                      | —                                                                        |
| Platform       | `privileged: true` supported | `code-executor` needs it — won't run on Fargate, Cloud Run, or some PaaS |
| Architecture   | `linux/amd64`                | Prebuilt images ship amd64 only; see Apple Silicon note below            |

On Docker Desktop for Mac, give Docker at least **8 GB RAM** and **64 GB disk** under Settings → Resources. The defaults are often too small.

**Apple Silicon (M-series) Macs:** prebuilt images are `linux/amd64`, so Docker Desktop will pull with an arch warning and run them under **Rosetta 2** emulation (auto-enabled on Docker Desktop 4.16+). Functional for evaluation and most local development; expect a 20–50% performance hit vs. native. For native arm64, build locally with `docker compose build` instead of `docker compose pull`.

**Linux arm64 hosts (e.g. Graviton):** install `qemu-user-static` (most distros include it) for amd64 emulation, or build locally.

---

## Deployment modes

Three compose files at the repo root. Pick one or compose them with `-f`.

### Mode 1 — OSS stack

The default Compose stack runs frontend, backend, worker, agentcc-gateway, serving, code-executor, postgres, clickhouse, redis, minio, rabbitmq, and temporal from published images.

```bash
docker compose up                                # foreground
docker compose up -d                             # detached
docker compose ps
docker compose logs -f backend
```

Binds the frontend on `0.0.0.0:3000`; data stores stay on `127.0.0.1`. Put a reverse proxy in front of the frontend for HTTPS in any non-laptop deployment.

### Mode 2 — Development mode

For Future AGI engineers or contributors hacking on the code. Layers `docker-compose.dev.yml` on top of the base compose.

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
```

Adds:

- **Hot reload** — `./futureagi` is volume-mounted into the backend and workers, so Python changes reload without a rebuild.
- **Per-queue workers** — six Temporal workers (`default`, `tasks_s`, `tasks_l`, `tasks_xl`, `trace_ingestion`, `agent_compass`) instead of one all-queue worker, mirroring production topology.
- **Public DB ports** — Postgres `5432`, ClickHouse `8123/9000`, Redis `6379`, MinIO `9000/9001`, Temporal `7233` all bind on `0.0.0.0` so DBeaver / DataGrip / `psql` on the host can connect.
- **Temporal UI + admin tools** — workflow inspection at <http://localhost:8085>.
- **`FAST_STARTUP=true`** — skips migrations on every restart (run them manually with `docker compose exec backend python manage.py migrate`).

The single all-queue `worker` service from Mode 1 is disabled in dev mode (moved behind the `oss-only` profile) so you don't get duplicate workers polling the same queues.

### Mode 3 — Frontend-only

For users who run the backend elsewhere (a VM, Future AGI Cloud, another Compose project, a Kubernetes cluster) and only want a local UI container.

```bash
VITE_HOST_API=https://api.your-backend.example.com \
  docker compose -f docker-compose.frontend.yml up -d
```

Or set `VITE_HOST_API` in `.env` and run without the inline variable. Restart the container to pick up changes — no rebuild required (the entrypoint regenerates `/config.js` from `VITE_HOST_API` on each start).

---

## Configuration

### The `.env` file

`docker compose` automatically loads `.env` from the directory where you run it. Start from the example:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Every knob in the compose file has a sensible local default, so the stack boots against an empty `.env`. For production, see [`deploy/README.md`](deploy/README.md) — the production overlay re-binds these with `${VAR:?error}` guards and refuses to boot on dev fallbacks.

### Optional values

Only needed if you enable the corresponding feature:

| Variable                                      | Used by                                                          |
| --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY`                              | Evaluations, agent loops, text simulation                        |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`                           | Same as above                                                    |
| `GOOGLE_API_KEY`                              | Gemini models                                                    |
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` / `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | Bedrock models, S3 object storage                                |
| `FUTURE_AGI_CLOUD_API_KEY`                    | Future AGI Cloud API features. Leave blank to run fully offline. |

### Ports reference

All ports are configurable via `.env`. Defaults:

| Service                    | Port   | URL                                    |
| -------------------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------- |
| Frontend                   | `3000` | <http://localhost:3000>                |
| Backend API                | `8000` | <http://localhost:8000>                |
| Gateway (LLM proxy)        | `8090` | internal only by default               |
| Model serving (embeddings) | `8080` | internal only by default               |
| Code executor              | `8060` | internal only by default               |
| Postgres                   | `5432` | `127.0.0.1` — dev mode only: `0.0.0.0` |
| ClickHouse HTTP            | `8123` | same                                   |
| ClickHouse TCP             | `9000` | same                                   |
| Redis                      | `6379` | same                                   |
| MinIO S3 API               | `9000` | same                                   |
| MinIO console              | `9001` | same                                   |
| Temporal gRPC              | `7233` | same                                   |
| Temporal UI                | `8085` | dev mode only                          |

To run two stacks side-by-side, copy `.env` to `.env.stackB`, change every port, and `docker compose --env-file .env.stackB -p stackb up`.

## Services and what they do

### Application services

| Service           | Purpose                                                                                                                |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `frontend`        | React SPA served by nginx. UI for traces, evals, datasets, playground.                                                 |
| `backend`         | Django API. Serves REST + gRPC + WebSockets. Reads/writes Postgres + ClickHouse + Redis + MinIO.                       |
| `worker`          | Single Temporal worker polling all queues. Replaced by six per-queue workers in dev mode.                              |
| `agentcc-gateway` | Go-based LLM proxy. Routes calls to OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Bedrock, Vertex. Handles retries, rate limits, logging. |
| `serving`         | Python service for embeddings and small model inference.                                                               |
| `code-executor`   | nsjail-sandboxed Python/JS code runner for evaluation code. **Requires `privileged: true`.**                           |

### Data stores

| Service      | Role                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `postgres`   | Primary transactional store (users, traces, datasets, evals, prompts, annotations).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `clickhouse` | Analytics store for traces, spans, dashboards, and evaluation queries.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `redis`      | Cache, rate limits, Celery/Django cache, WebSocket pub/sub. Also the invalidation bus between backend and fi-collector: the backend (`REDIS_URL`) and fi-collector (`FI_AUTH_REDIS_ADDR`) must point at the **same** Redis. A mismatch is a silent failure — key revocation and project-delete cache invalidation stop working and the collector's auth cache only expires via TTL.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `minio`      | S3-compatible object storage (uploaded files, eval artifacts). In production, swap for real S3 by setting `S3_ENDPOINT_URL` to an AWS endpoint. **Note:** the backend uses `S3_ENDPOINT_URL` (internal Docker hostname) to talk to MinIO, but URLs returned to the browser use `MINIO_URL` (defaults to `http://localhost:9005`). If you access the UI from anywhere other than the host machine — e.g. another machine on your LAN, a remote VM, or a domain name — set `MINIO_URL` in `.env` to a URL the browser can reach (e.g. `http://your-host.example.com:9005`). |

### Workflow engine

| Service    | Role                                                            |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `temporal` | Durable workflow server (auto-setup). Shares the main Postgres. |

## Configuring LLM providers

The gateway ships with `config.example.yaml`, enabling OpenAI by default. To enable more providers:

1. Copy the example:
   ```bash
   cp agentcc-gateway/config.example.yaml \
      agentcc-gateway/config.yaml
   ```
2. Uncomment the providers you want (Anthropic, Gemini, Bedrock, Vertex).
3. Set `AGENTCC_CONFIG_PATH=agentcc-gateway/config.yaml` in `.env`.
4. Set the matching `*_API_KEY` env vars in `.env`.
5. Restart: `docker compose up -d --force-recreate agentcc-gateway`.

Your `config.yaml` is gitignored by default — the example file uses `${VAR}` interpolation so the real key never has to live in source. Treat the file as a secret regardless.

### Vertex AI

Vertex needs a Bearer token from a GCP service account, not an API key. The recommended pattern:

```yaml
vertex:
  base_url: "https://us-central1-aiplatform.googleapis.com"
  api_key: "${GOOGLE_ACCESS_TOKEN}"
  api_format: "gemini"
  headers:
    x-gcp-project: "${GCP_PROJECT_ID}"
    x-gcp-location: "us-central1"
```

Set `GOOGLE_ACCESS_TOKEN` in `.env` and rotate it via a sidecar that calls `gcloud auth print-access-token`. **Do not mount `Vertex_AI_Creds.json` into the container** — it's covered by `.gitignore` but mounting it is still a bad habit. If a code path elsewhere in the platform genuinely needs the JSON keyfile (`GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`), arrange the volume mount yourself in a local compose override — never commit the file or bake it into a shared image.

---

## Email (SMTP)

Email is **optional for the initial setup** — you can create your first account via the CLI (see [Create your first account](#create-your-first-account)). However, email is required for:

- **Team invites** — invite links are sent by email
- **Password resets** — reset tokens are delivered by email

### Configuring Mailgun (recommended, free tier available)

[Mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com/) offers 100 emails/day free. Sign up, add a sending domain, and copy your API key.

Add to `.env`:

```bash
MAILGUN_API_KEY=your-mailgun-api-key
MAILGUN_SENDER_DOMAIN=mail.yourdomain.com
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL=Future AGI <noreply@mail.yourdomain.com>
```

Restart the backend: `docker compose up -d --force-recreate backend worker`.

### Password reset without email

If SMTP is not configured and a user needs a password reset, a shell admin can generate the reset link directly:

```bash
docker exec -it futureagi-backend-1 python manage.py shell
```

```python
from django.utils import timezone
from django.utils.http import urlsafe_base64_encode
from django.utils.encoding import force_bytes
from django.conf import settings
from accounts.models import User
from accounts.models.auth_token import AuthToken, AuthTokenType
from accounts.authentication import generate_encrypted_message

user = User.objects.get(email="user@example.com")
access_token = AuthToken.objects.create(
    user=user,
    auth_type=AuthTokenType.ACCESS.value,
    is_active=True,
    last_used_at=timezone.now(),
)
token = generate_encrypted_message({"user_id": str(user.id), "id": str(access_token.id)})
uidb64 = urlsafe_base64_encode(force_bytes(user.id))
print(f"{settings.APP_URL or 'http://localhost:3000'}/auth/jwt/verify/{uidb64}/{token}")
```

Share the printed URL over a private channel. It **signs the user in as that account**, so treat it like a password and have them use it promptly. If your `APP_URL` has no scheme, prefix the URL with `http://` or `https://` when opening it.

## Stack mode

The standard Compose stack runs the full OSS application path from published images:

| Mode         | Containers | What you get                                                                                                               | When to use                                                 |
| ------------ | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **standard** | ~12        | Frontend, backend, worker, agentcc-gateway, serving, code-executor, postgres, clickhouse, redis, minio, rabbitmq, temporal | Local evaluation, team installs, and VM-based self-hosting. |

Start it with:

```bash
docker compose up
```

## Upgrading

Each image is independently versioned. Bump the relevant variable(s) in `.env` (`FUTURE_AGI_VERSION` for backend + worker, `FRONTEND_VERSION`, `AGENTCC_GATEWAY_VERSION`, `SERVING_VERSION`, `CODE_EXECUTOR_VERSION`), then:

```bash
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

Backend migrations run automatically on startup. Downtime is ~30 seconds for the backend restart. Workers restart independently. To roll back, set the bumped variable(s) to the previous tag and re-run the same two commands.

## Backups

Named Docker volumes hold all state:

```bash
docker volume ls | grep future-agi
# future-agi_postgres-data
# future-agi_clickhouse-data
# future-agi_redis-data
# future-agi_minio-data
```

To back up Postgres:

```bash
docker compose exec postgres \
  pg_dump -U futureagi -d futureagi --format=custom \
  > backup-$(date +%F).dump
```

To restore:

```bash
docker compose exec -T postgres \
  pg_restore -U futureagi -d futureagi --clean --if-exists \
  < backup-2026-04-22.dump
```

For ClickHouse, prefer `BACKUP TABLE ... TO S3(...)` rather than file-level copies. See ClickHouse's [Backup and Restore docs](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/backup).

MinIO can be mirrored to any S3 endpoint via `mc mirror`.

## Troubleshooting

### `Cannot connect to the Docker daemon`

Docker isn't running. Start Docker Desktop (Mac/Windows) or `sudo systemctl start docker` (Linux).

### `ERROR: You don't have enough free space in /var/cache/apt/archives/`

Docker Desktop's virtual disk is full. Either:

- Settings → Resources → Disk image size — raise to 100 GB+.
- Clean up: `docker system prune -af && docker builder prune -af`.

### `ports are not available: exposing port ... address already in use`

Another process is using that port. Either kill it or override in `.env`:

```
FRONTEND_PORT=3100
BACKEND_PORT=8100
```

### Backend logs `FATAL: password authentication failed for user "futureagi"`

You changed `PG_PASSWORD` after the volume was created. Postgres initializes the password on first boot only. Either:

- Revert `PG_PASSWORD` to the original, or
- Wipe and reinitialize: `docker compose down -v` (⚠ destroys all data).

### Frontend loads but API calls fail with CORS errors

You're on a split-domain deployment without `VITE_HOST_API` set. Set it in `.env` (or your production env file) to your absolute backend URL and restart the frontend container:

```bash
echo "VITE_HOST_API=https://api.example.com" >> .env
docker compose up -d frontend
```

The container's entrypoint regenerates `/config.js` on each start, so no rebuild is needed.

### `code-executor` crashes with `clone: Operation not permitted`

The host kernel or container platform disallows `privileged: true` (Fargate, Cloud Run, some Kubernetes policies). Either run on a platform that allows privileged containers (EC2, GKE with privileged enabled, bare-metal) or disable code evaluation features.

### `temporal-server` keeps restarting

Postgres connection is the usual cause. Check `docker compose logs postgres` for OOM. Raise Docker Desktop's RAM to 8 GB+.
