"""
Data migration: re-seed demo datasets broken by the
ExperimentDatasetTable.prompt_config → legacy_prompt_config rename.

The bug crashed upload_demo_dataset at ExperimentDatasetTable.objects.create()
before rows/cells were created and before create_image_dataset() was reached.
Affected orgs have a Demo-dataset with 0 rows and no Image-Demo-dataset.

Idempotent: only targets demo datasets with 0 rows. Successfully reseeded
datasets have 50 rows and won't be matched on re-run.
