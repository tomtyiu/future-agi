"""Benchmark for the trace-scanner's per-query ClickHouse guardrails.

Two reportable facts, both against a loadgen-seeded ClickHouse:

  1. TRIPWIRE — under ``scan_ch_guardrails()`` with ``max_memory_usage`` pinned
     down to 1 MB, the scanner's real read (``list_by_trace_ids`` — ``FROM spans
     FINAL`` pulling the fat JSON columns, unchunked over all noise trace ids) is
     rejected with a query-level CH **code 241** instead of exhausting the
     server. A subsequent normal query on the same CH succeeds, proving the
     server stayed healthy after the query-level rejection (not a box-wide OOM).

  2. HEADROOM — a realistic scanner-sized batch (``_SWEEP_BATCH_SIZE`` trace ids)
     read under the real 36 GiB guardrail completes, and its ``system.query_log``
     peak ``memory_usage`` sits far below the cap. The peak is printed so the PR
     can report the measured number.

The guardrail's *sizing* (4 GiB right-headroom-but-below-ceiling) is justified by
the prod-scale dev-box numbers; this local run proves the *mechanism* end-to-end
on the scanner's actual reader.
