# partition ON, 0.45 is an *intra-category* bound whose candidates have already
# cleared a categorical filter, so restoring the partition loosens nothing only
# if the threshold tightens with it. A full 2x2 over 3 arrival orders falsified
# the coupling: the two effects are roughly additive, and the threshold's own
# contribution is +6.5pp coherence, 95% CI [-5.2, +18.0] — not distinguishable
# from zero. Tightening also splits more, and the fragmentation it costs is
# likewise unmeasurable at this sample size.
#
# So there is no evidence for moving the incumbent, and a constant that changes
# every user's feed needs evidence. Revisit only with a purity AND fragmentation
# reading, since coherence alone is maximised by all-singletons.

# Whether centroid matching is confined to the issue's own category.
#
# It used to be, unconditionally, which made a whole class of merge impossible
# rather than merely unlikely: the scanner picks the category, and one bug
# described two ways lands in two categories. On the post-fix-5 corpus this is
# visible directly — the SAME defect sits in two clusters purely because the
# categories differ:
#
#   S-232AA3EB  Context Handling Failures     15  "Queried past month instead of
#                                                  requested quarterly performance"
#   S-15263D7F  Poor Information Retrieval     5  "Fetched 1-month performance data
#                                                  instead of requested quarterly numbers"
#
# and likewise the hallucinated-holding bug across Poor Information Retrieval and
# Tool Output Misinterpretation. No embedding could ever merge those.
#
# That argument is now mostly spent, because distilling the brief before
# embedding fixes the same problem at its source: the phrase is stable, so what
# is left wavering is only the scanner's category choice, and it wavers on 1.2%
# of distinct phrases / 4.5% of issues.
#
# Turned back ON after measuring it on 792 issues from 62 tenants, re-scanned
# with the current scanner (the earlier corpus this was argued from had briefs
# that largely did not describe their own trace, so its numbers said nothing).
# Replayed per project, as assign_to_cluster runs, over 3 arrival orders, with
# within-entry pairs judged "would ONE fix resolve both?":
#
#   partition ON - OFF   +11.4pp coherence, 95% CI [+0.2, +22.4]
#
# The mechanism is visible without a judge: without the partition a single head
# entry absorbs several categories at once, filing a formatting complaint with a
# fabricated-data bug. The partition also makes assignment far more reproducible
# — largest entry varies by ~2 members across arrival orders with it, by ~60
# without, i.e. two tenants with identical data ingested in a different order
# would otherwise see materially different feeds.
#
# Cost is a handful of small stray fragments where the scanner picked different
# categories for one bug. Kept as a switch: if the strays ever outweigh the
# mixing, this reverts without a code change.

# or seeds a new cluster, and there is NO merge step. Two consequences, both measured
# on 261 real production issue briefs replayed through the real assignment loop:
#
#   * ORDER DEPENDENCE — the same issues in a different arrival order produce a
#     different clustering (pairwise ARI 0.796 across 20 orderings, min 0.673). About
#     a fifth of the grouping a user sees is decided by arrival order, not content.
#   * DUPLICATES THAT CAN NEVER HEAL — 7 groups were split across 14 clusters, i.e.
#     14% of the feed, with pairs as obviously identical as "Repeated same call log
#     chain 12 times in redundant retries" and "Retried identical chain execution 11
#     times producing empty outputs" shown as two separate entries.
#
# A full re-cluster would fix both but reassigns every issue and churns every cluster
# id under live users. This is the smaller change that targets the measured defect:
# a periodic pass that merges clusters whose CENTROIDS are already within threshold.
# It needs no re-embedding (centroids are in ClickHouse), touches only genuine
# duplicates, and moves the grouping toward the order-invariant answer over time.

    """Merge clusters whose centroids sit within ``threshold`` cosine distance.

    Greedy closest-pair-first, so the tightest duplicates collapse before looser ones.
    The larger cluster always absorbs the smaller, which keeps the surviving id the
    one users have already seen in the feed. Returns the number of merges performed.

    Two guards keep this a duplicate merge rather than a re-clustering. Both exist
    because without them the pass CHAINS: replayed over one project's real 234
    centroids it collapsed the feed to 127 entries, the largest holding 648 of the
    project's 1,285 traces across 46 original clusters — "answered without calling
    the tool", "reported holdings absent from tool output" and "answered about fees
    instead of performance" filed as one issue with one of their titles on it. That
    is a worse feed than the fragmentation the pass exists to fix.

      * SAME CATEGORY. Chaining is what a single-link rule does on a corpus with
        heavy shared vocabulary — every brief here says "portfolio", so a path of
        near-neighbours runs from any issue to any other. The category is the one
        axis a merge must not cross, because it is what decides where the fix goes.
        Restoring it alone took the largest merged entry from 46 clusters to 19.
      * MUTUAL NEAREST NEIGHBOUR. Each side must be the other's closest cluster, so
        a large cluster cannot act as a hub that swallows everything with the
        threshold in reach. Takes the largest merged entry from 19 clusters to 11.

    Together: 234 -> 210 entries, 13 merges, every one of them a genuine duplicate —
    including two pairs whose titles were character-identical.

    ``PARTITION_BY_CATEGORY`` gates assignment the same way, so category is strict
    at BOTH stages: an issue never joins a cluster of a different category, and two
    clusters of different categories never merge. State the consequence plainly —
    one defect filed under two categories stays two entries permanently, because no
    path exists by which they reunite. That is a real cost, paid to keep the
    chaining above in check, and it is the number to weigh when revisiting either
    guard.

    ``max_merges`` bounds a single pass: this runs periodically, so it is better to
    make steady progress than to hold a long transaction over a pathological project.
