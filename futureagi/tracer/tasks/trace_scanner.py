    The collector writes spans straight to CH and bypasses the inline scanner
    trigger, so this sweep is the only trigger for CH-only traces. Per observe
    project with scanning enabled and a non-zero rate: take root candidates in
    ``[last_swept_at, now-grace]`` of ``created_at``, drop already-scanned,
    pre-sample, dispatch ``scan_traces_task`` (which chains embed -> cluster),

    The watermark never passes a sampled-in trace until that trace has a durable
    marker — so a scan task that dies before writing one (CH/gateway outage) is
    retried next tick, not lost. Pre-sampling here (same stable verdict as
    ``scan_and_write``) is what lets the cursor lag behind only sampled-in work
    without a marker per skipped trace, and avoids dispatching no-op tasks for a
    low-sampling project. A trace stuck unscanned past ``_SWEEP_MAX_LAG_SECONDS``
    (sustained outage, or a candidate root that resolves no span data) is
    FAILED-marked so it can't pin the cursor or grow the scan window unbounded —
