"""Regression tests for the category partition on centroid matching.

Candidate centroids are filtered by ``family`` (the scanner's category) before
the distance sort, so two clusters in different categories can never merge no
matter how close their embeddings sit. That was dropped once, because the
scanner picks the category from free text and one defect described two ways
lands in two categories:

    S-232AA3EB  Context Handling Failures     15 traces
    S-15263D7F  Poor Information Retrieval     5 traces

both "asked for a quarter, queried a different period".

Distilling the brief before embedding fixes that at the source — the phrase is
now stable, and only the category choice wavers, on 1.2% of distinct phrases
and 4.5% of issues. Replaying one project's 1,277 real issues without the
partition, three of the four groups that appear only in that configuration are
one bug with mis-categorised strays, and the fourth is 312 members spanning
eight categories with none above 45%, filing "gives investment advice despite
policy prohibiting it" alongside "responds with irrelevant disclaimer". The
partition is back on: it costs the strays and prevents that entry.

These assert on the emitted SQL rather than standing up ClickHouse: what is
being pinned is which rows are *eligible* to be sorted, which is a property of
the statement. The toggle is exercised in both positions so flipping it stays a
one-line change rather than a code change.
