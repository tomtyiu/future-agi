"""Point / trace / id CH span reads must not OOM under FINAL (TH-6442).

TH-6515 (PR #1373) gave the multi-trace batch reads
(``list_by_trace_ids`` / ``roots_by_trace_ids``) the ``use_skip_indexes_if_final``
setting and dropped the redundant ``is_deleted = 0`` predicate, but left the
single-row / point-read siblings that back the annotation add + trace-detail
render paths, and the eval FK resolver's ``list_root_spans_by_trace_ids``.
Each does ``SELECT <fat cols incl attributes_extra> FROM spans FINAL WHERE
<id | trace_id | parent_span_id> = X`` — pruning only via a bloom skip index,
which CH 25.3 disables under FINAL by default. Without the setting the read
does a full in-order merge over every part and OOMs (code 241) on a wide
(voice) span whose ``attributes_extra`` carries a whole raw log.

A 9 GiB OOM can't be reproduced in test-CH, so — mirroring
``test_scan_project_scoped_read.py`` — these pin the two levers that prevent the
unpruned merge: the skip-index setting is on, and the ``is_deleted = 0``
predicate (which, alongside the setting, arms the ``is_deleted`` minmax-index
resurrection bug — the 2-arg ReplacingMergeTree drops deleted rows under FINAL
anyway) is off. A revert of either fails here rather than as a prod OOM.
