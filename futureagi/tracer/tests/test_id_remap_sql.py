"""Unit tests for the P3b id-remap SQL helpers (``id_remap_sql``).

These assert the EMITTED SQL STRUCTURE — the survivor-collapse contract that
fixes the gate-C2 many-old→one-new fan-out (a post-flip ``new_X`` span fanning
across every duplicate remap row → user split + double-count). The end-to-end
behavioural proof (gate C2 reads ONE row / 450 tok, gate C straddler still 514,
gate B no-op on the real 1:1 baseline) is the ch_rehearsal harness; this file is
the fast regression guard so the structure can't silently revert.
