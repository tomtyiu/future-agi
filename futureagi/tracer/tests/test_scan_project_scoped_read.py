"""Project-scoped span reads for the trace-scanner + feed pipelines.

The spans table's primary-key prefix starts with ``project_id``; ``trace_id`` is
below it in the sorting key and absent from the primary key. A ``trace_id IN``
read with no ``project_id`` therefore cannot prune parts, so a FINAL merge spans
the whole table and blows the ClickHouse memory limit. These tests pin the
project scoping onto the reads that hold a project_id, so a revert that drops the
filter fails loudly here rather than as an out-of-memory crash in production.
