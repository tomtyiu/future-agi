"""Feed-path CH span reads must not OOM under FINAL.

The feed detail / list / trends / traces surface fans out into several
``FROM spans FINAL WHERE <trace_id | id | session> = X`` rollup reads whose only
prefilter is a bloom skip index — which CH 25.3 disables under FINAL by default.
Without ``use_skip_indexes_if_final`` each degrades to a full in-order merge over
every part (seconds each, run serially) and OOMs (code 241) on a tenant with
volume.

Mirrors ``test_span_reader_point_read_oom.py``: a real 9 GiB OOM can't run in
test-CH, so these pin the two levers that prevent the unpruned merge —
(A) the skip-index setting is on and the ``is_deleted = 0`` predicate (which,
alongside the setting, arms the ``is_deleted`` minmax resurrection bug; the 2-arg
ReplacingMergeTree drops deleted rows under FINAL anyway) is off; and
(B) where the caller knows the tenant, a ``project_id`` predicate is threaded so
the primary-key prefix prunes too. A revert of either fails here, not as a prod
OOM.
