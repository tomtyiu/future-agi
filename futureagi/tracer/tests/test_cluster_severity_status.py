"""Regression tests for fixes 6 and 7 — severity and status honesty.

Both fields were decided once, at cluster creation, from a single seed issue,
and never recomputed. In production that produced a feed where the grades
carried no information: 72% of clusters were high/critical, and 234 of 235 were
"escalating" — including 138 singletons seen exactly once.

Fix 6 re-derives severity from the cluster's *current* title (which after fix 3b
describes the group rather than one arbitrary member) and applies volume as a
floor. Fix 7 stops claiming a trend below a threshold where there is none.

Neither invents a model. They make the existing labels defensible.
