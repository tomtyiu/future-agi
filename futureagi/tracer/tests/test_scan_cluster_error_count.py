"""The Feed's occurrence count must equal the members it claims to count.

``assign_to_cluster`` incremented ``error_count`` unconditionally while both
membership writes it counts are idempotent — the issue's cluster FK is an
``update``, the junction row a ``get_or_create``. Re-running the scan over a
trace therefore bumped the number the Feed renders as "occurrences" without
adding a member.

Measured on live data before the fix: a fifth of rendered scanner entries were
wrong, the worst showing **33 occurrences against 3 issues across 3 traces**, and
none of the gap was explained by soft-deleted issues. ``unique_traces`` sat
beside it and stayed correct for the one reason that matters here — it was always
recomputed from rows rather than incremented. Both counts are now derived the
same way.

The merge path had the same shape: it summed both sides' counters after
re-pointing every issue, so it carried the drift forward and compounded it on
each subsequent merge.

ClickHouse is mocked; the assertions are on PG counts, which is where the
rendered number lives.
