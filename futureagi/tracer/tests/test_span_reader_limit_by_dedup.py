"""``dedup_via_limit_by`` must reproduce ``spans FINAL`` exactly (TH-7226).

Three rules, each silent when broken: is_deleted filtered AFTER the dedup (else
deleted rows resurrect), the full sorting key as the dedup key, and every column
named (MATERIALIZED columns are absent from ``SELECT *``; the lean select stubs
heavy ones to a bare ``''``). The SQL-shape tests pin all three without CH,
mirroring ``test_span_reader_point_read_oom.py``; the last test proves the
semantics against a real ReplacingMergeTree.
