"""The incremental centroid update must read the CURRENT centroid version.

``cluster_centroids`` is a ReplacingMergeTree and ``assign_to_cluster`` INSERTs a
new row per member instead of updating one, so every historical version of a
centroid coexists until a background merge collapses them. The read that feeds the
running mean therefore has to name which version it wants. It used to be a bare
``SELECT ... LIMIT 1``, which returns an arbitrary one: the mean gets computed from
a stale vector and a stale ``member_count``, and since that count is the weight in
``_update_centroid`` the error compounds into every later update rather than washing
out.

DB-free: every Django and ClickHouse collaborator is mocked. These are
revert-catchers on the query shape, not proof the SQL is right — a mocked client
cannot execute ClickHouse. Two hazards specific to this fix are covered
because both are silent in production:

  - dropping ``GROUP BY`` while keeping ``argMax``. An aggregate with no GROUP BY
    always returns exactly one row, so a cluster with no stored centroid would come
    back as a phantom row of empty defaults and ``if rows:`` would take the wrong
    branch, seeding the running mean from an empty vector instead of the issue.
  - dropping the tuple recency key back to plain ``last_updated``, which is
    second-granularity: two members joining one cluster inside the same second are
    unordered, and the tie-break has to be ``member_count`` because it is the only
    monotonically growing column available.
