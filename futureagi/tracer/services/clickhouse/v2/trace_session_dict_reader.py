"""trace_session_dict_reader — batch ``external_session_id`` lookups from the CH
``trace_sessions_dict`` (DESIGN §5.2, the Session-name reads cutover).

Why this exists
---------------
Before the CH-derived-dimensions migration the session list/detail builders
emitted ``session_name=None`` and the view back-filled it from PG
``TraceSession.name``. Once TraceSession's *external identity* moves to CH
(``trace_sessions`` RMT / ``trace_sessions_dict``), the session's external id —
the OTel ``session.id`` string the user passed — lives in the dict keyed by
``trace_session_id`` (the span's OWN soft-id column), NOT in PG.

The session display name is then
``COALESCE(overlay.display_name, trace_sessions_dict.external_session_id)``
(DESIGN §5.2): this module resolves the CH half (``external_session_id``); the
PG ``TraceSessionOverlay.display_name`` override is layered on top by the caller.

A CH ``dictGet`` cannot run inside a PG queryset, so the read path resolves the
per-session ``trace_session_id`` in PG/CH-spans first (a plain column read, no FK
join), then calls this module to batch-resolve the
``{trace_session_id -> external_session_id}`` labels from CH and merges in Python.
This module is the CH half of that restructure — a sibling of
``end_user_dict_reader`` for the Session dimension.

Faithfulness to the old back-fill semantics (the parity contract)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The old back-fill produced ``None`` whenever no PG ``TraceSession`` row matched
the span's ``trace_session_id``. We reproduce it with ``dictGetOrNull``: a key
MISSING from the dict returns NULL (NOT the column's ``''`` default that a plain
``dictGet`` would give), so a session id with no curated row resolves to ``None``
exactly like the old PG miss did.

NOTE on the empty-string coercion: ``trace_sessions.external_session_id`` is a
non-null String (schema 018) populated from PG ``TraceSession.name`` (which is
``null=True``); the backfill/collector coerce PG NULL → ``''``. So a session
whose PG ``name`` was NULL surfaces ``''`` here, whereas the old back-fill (which
read ``name`` straight off the row) would surface ``None``. We normalize ``''`` →
``None`` so a name-less session renders identically OLD vs NEW. (A genuine
empty-string external id — none observed on the box — would also collapse to
``None``; accepted, the column is a display label.)

This module is read-only: a failure here is a real read error (parity reads must
surface problems, unlike the best-effort ingest dual-write), so it does NOT
swallow exceptions.

EXISTENCE + FIELDS (P3b step2 — the Slice C/D/E/F building block)
----------------------------------------------------------------
``resolve_external_session_ids`` above is *forward id → display label* only and
reads the dict (a 60–120s-stale label cache is fine for a name back-fill). Step2
needs two MORE resolutions that the dict cannot serve:

  • ``session_exists(project_id, trace_session_id)`` — does this id name a known
    session? Used by the annotation-queue / eval-dispatch validation branches
    (Slices C/E) that today do a PG ``TraceSession`` ``.get``/``.first`` — which
    404s a *net-new* session (no PG row post-flip) and a *straddler* queried by
    its NEW deterministic id.
  • ``resolve_session_fields(trace_session_ids)`` — the curated identity
    (``external_session_id``, ``first_seen``) PLUS the PG overlay
    (``bookmarked``, ``display_name``) for a batch of ids (Slices C/D).

Both read the ``trace_sessions`` TABLE (``FINAL``), **not** ``trace_sessions_dict``,
for two reasons the dict cannot satisfy: (a) the dict (schema 018) exposes only
``external_session_id`` — it has **no ``first_seen``**, which the fields read must
return; (b) the dict's ``LIFETIME(60,120)`` means a just-written net-new row is
invisible for up to 120 s, which would make an eval-dispatch existence check
flap. Reading the RMT with ``FINAL`` gives ``first_seen`` AND immediate
visibility of the collector's dual-write row. Both resolutions are **remap-aware**
(``id_remap_sql``): a straddler answers true / resolves to ONE unified entity
whether queried by its OLD curated id or its NEW deterministic id.

``resolve_session_fields`` is therefore NOT CH-only — it overlays PG
``TraceSessionOverlay`` (the UI-sourced ``bookmarked``/``display_name``, DESIGN
§5) by the **resolved** (old/survivor) ``trace_session_id``, exactly the
Score/annotation soft-id overlay pattern. (Keying the overlay by the resolved id
— not the input id — is load-bearing: a bookmark is written on the OLD PG id, so
a straddler queried by its NEW id must resolve to the old id BEFORE the overlay
lookup or the bookmark is silently missed.)
