"""
v2 MonitorMetrics query builder — targets the CH 25.3 spans schema.

Subclass + post-rewrite. Monitors poll metric values (current + historical
+ time series) for the alerting/monitoring surface; they're high-frequency
read-only and hit `spans` heavily, so the v2 typed-Map columns reduce
per-poll cost. `V2RewriteMixin` routes every inherited `build*` method's SQL
through the v2 rewriter at one boundary.

    the rewrite-safe ``deleted``-based form, so nothing needs excluding.
