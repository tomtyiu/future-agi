"""end_user_dict_reader — batch ``user_id`` label lookups from the CH
``end_users_dict`` (DESIGN §4.3, the EndUser reads cutover).

Why this exists
---------------
Before the CH-derived-dimensions migration, callers resolved an EndUser's
external ``user_id`` label by traversing the PG ``ObservationSpan.end_user`` FK
into ``tracer_enduser`` (``end_user__user_id``). Once EndUser moves to CH, the PG
``tracer_enduser`` table is gone, so the label now lives in the CH
``end_users_dict`` keyed by ``end_user_id`` (the span's OWN soft-id column).

A CH ``dictGet`` cannot run inside a PG queryset, so the read paths that used a
correlated ``Subquery``/``OuterRef`` must RESTRUCTURE: resolve the per-entity
``end_user_id`` in PG (a plain column read, no FK join), then call this module to
batch-resolve the ``{end_user_id -> user_id}`` labels from CH, and merge in
Python. This module is the CH half of that restructure.

Faithfulness to the old FK semantics (the parity contract)
----------------------------------------------------------
The old ``Subquery(...values("end_user__user_id"))`` yields **NULL** in three
cases: the span's ``end_user_id`` is NULL, the FK points at a row that does not
exist (``db_constraint=False`` allows orphans), or the joined ``user_id`` is
NULL. We reproduce exactly:

  • Callers never pass a NULL ``end_user_id`` here (they map it to ``None``
    label without calling this module), covering the first case.
  • For a present ``end_user_id`` we use ``dictGetOrNull`` — a MISSING dict key
    returns NULL (NOT the column's ``''`` default that plain ``dictGet`` would
    give), so an orphan id resolves to ``None`` exactly like the FK miss did.

This module is read-only and best-effort-free: a failure here is a real read
error (unlike the ingest dual-write, parity reads must surface problems), so it
does NOT swallow exceptions.

    SET from the CH ``end_users`` RMT (the state-robust reverse lookup,
    PG_ORM_READ_MIGRATION §"The state-robust reverse-resolve pattern").

    This is the CH replacement for the PG ``EndUser.objects.get/filter(
    user_id=…, project_id=…/organization=…)`` natural-key→surrogate lookups that
    go STALE for a NET-NEW user post-step2 (no PG row is ever written for an
    identity first seen after the ingest ``get_or_create`` is dropped). Reading
    the curated ``end_users`` dimension instead catches all three post-flip
    cases in ONE query, with NO ``deterministic_id`` compute (so it works for a
    ``user_id``-only filter where ``user_id_type`` is unavailable):

      • historical user — its OLD-id ``end_users`` row,
      • net-new user — its post-flip deterministic-id ``end_users`` row (rides
        the best-effort ingest dual-write; filterable a few seconds late),
      • straddler — BOTH rows pre-consolidation-sweep, the survivor after.

    The returned ids are the CURATED keys (OLD pre-sweep, survivor post-sweep).
    Callers feed them to a spans filter that resolves each span's stored
    ``end_user_id`` new→old via ``end_user_id_remap`` and matches THIS set
    (``resolved_id_expr(end_user_id) IN <set>``): a historical/net-new span
    (no remap entry) resolves to itself and matches its own curated id; a
    straddler's new-id span resolves to the old id and matches. This is exactly
    the id-set the committed ``filters._build_enduser_string_condition`` builds
    inline — exposed here so a VIEW-level resolve (which cannot embed a CH
    subquery in a PG queryset) gets the same state-robust semantics. NO remap
    is applied HERE: ``end_users`` already holds the curated keys; the remap
    belongs on the SPANS side at filter time.

    Scope (mirrors the PG queries' ``project_id`` / ``organization`` scoping —
    ``end_users`` carries BOTH columns, schema 017): pass ``project_id`` for the
    project-scoped lookup (1265/2768), or ``organization_id`` for the org-wide
    session view's cross-project user filter (2014, org-scope mode), or both
    (2014, project mode). At least one MUST be given — an unscoped reverse
    lookup would leak ids across tenants; a missing scope raises ``ValueError``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    user_id : the external user-id string (coerced to ``str``).
    project_id : optional project UUID scope.
    organization_id : optional organization UUID scope.
    user_id_type : when supplied (including ``None``), adds an exact
        ``user_id_type`` match — ``None``/``''`` map to the SQL ``''`` the
        writer stores for a NULL type (schema 017 coerces NULL→'' on write), so
        a typed filter round-trips faithfully. OMIT it (the default) to match
        on ``user_id`` ALONE across every type — the common product filter,
        and the form that avoids the ``user_id_type``-availability trap.

    Returns a de-duplicated ``list[str]`` of ``end_user_id`` values (``[]`` when
    nothing matches — the caller treats that as "no such user", an EMPTY id-set
    that filters to zero rows). Read-only and NOT best-effort: a CH failure is a
    real read error and re-raises (parity reads must surface problems).
