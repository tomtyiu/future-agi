backfill_pg_to_ch — resumable PG tracer_observation_span → CH spans backfill.

Design summary (full rationale in DECISIONS.md #013–#016):
    • Unit of work is one (project_id, hour_bucket) window. Windows are
      discovered once via a GROUP BY on PG, then processed in order.
    • Per-window state lives in CH default.backfill_checkpoints. Because the
      target table is ReplacingMergeTree on (_version, is_deleted), re-running
      a window is CORRECT (not just safe) — the checkpoint is a SPEED
      optimization that lets us skip already-done work on restart, not a
      correctness gate. Lose the checkpoint table and you only pay re-work,
      never wrong data.
    • Within a window, rows are streamed with KEYSET pagination
      (`(start_time, id) > $last`) so unbounded-skew hours (one busy
      project's busy minute = 100M rows) still process with bounded memory.
    • Rows are converted in pure Python (see pg_to_ch_adapter.adapt) and
      inserted via the clickhouse-driver NATIVE protocol in sync batches
      (default 50k). We do NOT use async_insert — that's an ingest-edge
      tool; for bulk loads, sync batches give us per-batch error visibility
      and clean backpressure.
    • Per-row conversion failures go to default.spans_v2_dead_letter with
      the original PG row as raw JSON; the batch continues. Per-batch CH
      insert failures retry up to 3x then mark the window failed and move on.
    • After all batches in a window, count parity check
      (PG window count == CH window count + dead-letter count). If mismatch,
      checkpoint = 'failed_validation'; operator runs the dead-letter triage
      query and either retries or accepts the gap.

#   JSON(max_dynamic_paths=0)". clickhouse-connect (HTTP) serializes JSON
#   payloads as strings and lets the server parse them into the typed JSON
#   column, which works correctly. Throughput cost is small (~10-20%) for
#   bulk loads and well within our budget. Caught by the smoke test against
