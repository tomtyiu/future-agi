"""Prefix-dedup pagination for the CH list endpoints.

The span/trace list Phase-1 queries dropped ``LIMIT 1 BY <key>`` — that
clause de-duplicated globally but forced ClickHouse to read + full-sort the
entire filtered window before paginating (O(window) memory; OOM-crashed the
server at ~10M rows). De-duplicating only the returned page in Python fixed
the crash but broke a cross-page invariant: a duplicate pair straddling a
page boundary (un-merged ReplacingMergeTree versions), or a multi-root trace
whose roots sort far apart, could surface the same key on two pages.

``paginate_deduped()`` restores the global-dedup semantics at bounded cost:
the builder fetches the sorted PREFIX ``[0, offset + 2*page_size)`` (a
bounded top-K read — NOT the O(window) sort), this helper de-duplicates the
prefix keeping the first occurrence per key (the same row ``LIMIT 1 BY``
kept), and slices ``[offset, offset + page_size)`` of the de-duplicated
sequence. Every page is then a disjoint slice of the same global
de-duplicated stream, so:

* a key can never appear on two pages, and
* no key is ever skipped, as long as the prefix holds at least
  ``offset + page_size`` distinct keys — guaranteed for up to ``page_size``
  duplicates in the prefix (duplicates are rare, transient singletons; a
  pathological mass-duplication can only shorten a page, never duplicate
  or permanently hide a row, and self-heals on the next merge).

Cost: page 0 transfers ``2*page_size`` light rows (same order as before);
page N transfers ``N*page_size + 2*page_size`` — a few MB even hundreds of
pages deep, versus the whole window under the old ``LIMIT 1 BY``.
