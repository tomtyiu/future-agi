"""Shared wire contract for deployment telemetry.

SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for the registration/heartbeat payload shape, the
size/volume caps, and the email-domain derivation. This module's body is
**vendored verbatim** into the receiver repo at
``ee/cloud/telemetry/schema.py`` (only the module docstring,
which names each copy's role, differs). A contract test
(``test_schema_contract``) asserts every public constant in the two copies
agrees and that a payload built here validates on the receiver, so a cap or
field bumped on one side can't silently diverge from the other.

Dependency-free on purpose: no Django, no DRF. Both repos import the same
constants and the same helpers; the builders/serializers wrap them.

Wire-compatibility rule: bump ``SCHEMA_VERSION`` on any change to field
names, caps, or semantics. The receiver rejects payloads whose major
version it does not understand.
