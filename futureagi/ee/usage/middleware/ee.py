"""EE Feature Middleware — gate EE-only features based on deployment mode + license.

On self-hosted: checks EE_LICENSE_KEY → license.features[].
On cloud: checks PlanEntitlement (handled by existing entitlement service).
With no EE license and not cloud: blocks EE features entirely.

Add to MIDDLEWARE in settings to enable.
